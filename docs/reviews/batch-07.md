# Batch 07 review and integration record

Date: 2026-10-01. Sole merger: `batch07_merger`. Starting main: `0a10f4230c312cc9874be0e6499fd784b3ceba9c`; [plan](../plans/2026-10-01-batch-07.md).

## COS-18 Phase A approval checkpoint

Root handed off exact source `d80842961800da78cb4ddfcf29315f0e8ef776ef` on `feat/cos-18-cli`, independently approved by `cos18_reviewer` as `PHASE_A_READY` without P1/P2 findings. The reviewer inspected the actual nine-file diff and UTF-8 safety. The author's evidence includes 49 focused checks, 21 new-module checks including two actual process-exit scenarios, typecheck and build. These are offline platform checks; no paid generation passed.

Main is clean at the specified baseline, and that baseline is the approved source's merge base. Integration and focused checks are pending. The merger will preserve the approved implementation byte for byte and will not alter the active author worktree.

Phase A covers intake accounting, current-draft confirmation and same-lock one-time activation. Public CLI/stdin, complete host assembly, run control and delivery remain Phase B work. COS-18 / #19 remains open. COS-01 resource metadata documentation also awaits independent approval and exact-SHA handoff.

The batch does not change paid runtime status: shared cost is 892,282 micro-CNY with zero reserved/unknown charges; both failed pilot attempts and the expired fixed trial remain final under their original limits. COS-10 / #11, COS-11 / #12 and COS-13 / #14 remain open awaiting live evidence; COS-12 / #13 remains closed and G3 stays closed. The reference baseline remains provisional with 230 entries and 221 unknown entries.
